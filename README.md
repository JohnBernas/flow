# Flow [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kabisaict/flow.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kabisaict/flow) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/kabisaict/flow.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/kabisaict/flow) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/kabisaict/flow/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/kabisaict/flow)

Flow is a KanBan layer on top of Zendesk.

## Benefits

With Flow you can get an internal Scrum layer on top of the Zendesk
external support interface. You can easily rearrange priorities and get a
quick overview where your colleagues are currently working on.
Synchronization is done through Zendesk tags. The application is still
heavily in development, but the following features are currently
implemented:

* Drag and drop KanBan interface
* Websockets for pushing state between clients
* Swimlanes based on ticket tags
* One way synchronization (Zendesk -> Flow)
* Story details in KanBan include Zendesk id, title, and a link to the
  Zendesk ticket

## Deployment

Due to the use of Websockets (and background workers) it is a bit more
involved to deploy the application to a server. You *can* use Heroku, but
you will need more than one worker to run the application.

A "start from scratch" server setup-guide will be added to the Wiki in the
future.

## Development

Flow is tested against ruby 2.0.0. Setting Flow up for local development
requires a few manual steps:

    brew install redis
    bundle install
    rake db:migrate
    cp db/seeds.example.rb config/seeds.rb    # Modify to set correct data
    rake db:seed

The easiest way to run the required processes is by using the `Procfile`.

    gem install foreman
    foreman start
